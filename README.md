<h3>Linear Regression implementation using gradient descent.</h3>

In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. 

<h3>Loss Function</h3>
The loss is the error in our predicted value of m and c. Our goal is to minimize this error to obtain the most accurate value of m and c.
We will use the Mean Squared Error function to calculate the loss.
